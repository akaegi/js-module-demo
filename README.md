# Get started

Play around with different module systems by generating JavaScript output with:
- CommonJS modules (`npm run build:main`)
- UMD modules (`npm run build:umd`)
- AMD modules (`npm run build:amd`)
- ES6 modules (`npm run build:esm`)

Start the dev server using `npm run start` and look at
- `index-esm.html` (browser native ES6 modules)
- `index-amd.html` (AMD modules with RequireJS loaded into browser)
- `index-webpack.html` (Webpack bundled build Ã  la Angular)

# History of JavaScript module systems 

https://www.zachgollwitzer.com/posts/scripts-commonjs-umd-amd-es6-modules

- Initially `<script>` tags only
    - Everything is global
    - Name clashes when libraries use the same identifiers

- CommonJS (CJS) (2009)
    - `exports` object and `require()` function
    - came with Node.js
    - `require()` is synchronous and thus not suitable for browsers

---

## Alternatives for the browser

- AMD (Asynchronous module definition) and RequireJS (2009)
    `define()` function

- UMD (universal module definition) pattern (2015)

- ECMAScript modules (esm) since ES6/ECMAScript 2015

- Bundlers like Webpack (2012)

---

## ES6 modules

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules

- JavaScript file that contains an `import`  or `export` statement is considered a module

- `export`s define the public interface of the module

- `import` is used to import other modules

- `import` as static statement vs. `import` [operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import) 
(function that returns a promise with the Module namespace object used for dynamic module loading)

- "Equivalent" to Typescript modules

---

### ES6 modules in the browser

- ES6 modules are natively supported in modern browsers
(https://caniuse.com/es6-module)

- Use an `importmap` to map module names to files

- `import` without `.js` suffix does not work without `importmap` (see example)
(and Typescript doesn't add `.js` suffix to generated JavaScript files...)

---

### Default export problem

- There is a mismatch between CommonJS module `exports` and ES6 `export`
(most of the libraries on https://www.npmjs.com/ are distributed as UMD modules with CommonJS support)

- CommonJS can export anything from a module
(e.g. lodash exports a `function` that also serves as an object with properties)

- ES6 modules always export a Module namespace object with properties for every exported "member"

- Default export (`export default smiley`) is available as property `default` on Module namespace object

- `import smiley from 'module-demo/smiley'` is syntactic sugar for
  `import { default as smiley } from ''module-demo/smiley'`

---

### Default export problem: Example lodash

- `lodash.d.ts`: `export = _`
  (Typescript [special syntax](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/modules.html#export--and-import--require) for CommonJS style exports)

Three possibilities:

1. `import * as lodash from 'lodash'` makes Typescript compile happily

    - When used in a native ES6 module environment however, the `lodash` object is a Module NS object which is not callable (see demo)

---
2. `@ts-ignore import lodash from 'lodash'`

    - works, too! (because we know the esm version of the library `lodash-es` indeed does a default export)
    - however this does not work for `module: umd`, `module: commonjs` etc.
      (`_.chain(...)` is "transpiled" to `lodash_1.default.chain(...)`)

3. `import lodash from 'lodash'` with `esModuleInterop` set to `true`
    
    - works in both ES6 and UMD environments (see demo) because of helper function `__importDefault`

- for me the best option is to use (1) if the imported module needs not to be called or (3) otherwise

---

## Webpack (2012) 

Webpack is a wide-spread bundler and used by Angular CLI internally.
It bundles all modules into a single `bundle.js`.
This is well explained in [here](https://lihautan.com/what-is-module-bundler-and-how-does-it-work/).

TL;DL: All modules are packed into one big map keyed by module name.
`__webpack_require__(...)` is then just a lookup into the map.

I've not yet looked into the options of different *output* module formats of Webpack
or dynamic module loading with Webpack.
